# Directions #

Create a new database,
add a table
add two columns (one auto incrementing field for an ID #/number of the row and another column (varchar 50) to hold a string of text)

create a function which takes as its input a string of text.
the function should return a new string comprised of the vowels of the input string in the order they appeared in the input string.
For example:
If the input string is: onomatopoeia
the returned string would be: ooaooeia
save the returned string in the db
